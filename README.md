# HTTP Templates for NodeMCU and Arduino Framework

### About this Repository

This repository keeps simple templates codes for NodeMCU boards using Arduino Framework and ESP8266-related libraries for high-level WiFi functionalities. The templates avaliable give some directions on where to start from to implement customized applications as HTTP webservers (connected or AP) or webclients. Starting from these templates, you will be able to adapt the code to create your own applications using these technologies.
